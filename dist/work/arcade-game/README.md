# Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Game

I made this game as a project for my Front-End Web Development Nanodegree from Udacity.

## How to play

Use the direction keys on your keyboard to move your character up, down, left, or right. Make it to the water without getting hit by the ladybugs and you get a point! See how many points you can get before you lose all three of your lives!

## Getting started

In order to play this game, you can either clone the git project, or you can play it online at https://grantiverson.github.io/work/arcade-game/index.html. If you want to download the files, open index.html in your browser to start playing.
