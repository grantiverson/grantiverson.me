### How I made this app

I created everything from scratch.
My first instruction was to display a cat image with a line of text that displayed the number of times the image had been clicked.

Then, then I had to make it work for two images.
Finally, I was tasked with creating a menu that selected and displayed one cat image, and the appropriate click counter.

I wrote the app with the Model-View-Controller pattern so this app could easily be scaled up to include many more cat images.
